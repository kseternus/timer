This Python program implements a countdown timer where the user inputs a time in HH:MM:SS format.<br />
The program continuously displays the remaining time and updates the countdown in real-time.<br />
When the timer reaches zero, it plays an alarm sound using the playsound module to play alarm.mp3.<br />
The timer also handles user input validation to ensure the format is correct. Key components include:<br />

    Time input: User provides duration in hours, minutes, and seconds.
    Countdown: Real-time countdown display.
    Alarm: Sound alert when the time is up.
